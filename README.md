**Be Local** is an application that connects Koreans with local knowledge and experience to foreign travelers. Travelers can explore South Korea with locals who are well-acquainted with hidden gems like local eateries and shops, rather than relying on professional guides. This approach presents a new paradigm distinct from conventional travel guide services.

**Travelers** can use the Be Local app to directly choose guides based on their personalities, travel styles, and preferences, allowing for a more personalized travel experience.

Any individual residing in South Korea can become a **guide** on Be Local. As long as they possess a good understanding of their local area and have sufficient foreign language communication skills, they can select and meet travelers whose travel preferences align with their own. This provides an opportunity for local residents to utilize their knowledge and experiences, earning supplementary income while engaging in diverse cultural exchange and international interactions.

Be Local utilizes matching based on shared interests and preferences, offering unique and localized experiences that go beyond typical tourist itineraries, catering to travelers seeking such experiences and local guides eager to provide them.
